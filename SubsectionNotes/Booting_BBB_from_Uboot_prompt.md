## Booting Beaglebone Black Board from U-boot Prompt without uEnv.txt

**Important Note:** 
In the course they will Boot from eMMC storage as the older Image had two partitions. But that is not the case in the updated image. So, for time being it is not possible for us to boot from eMMC storage. But we'll Boot from the uSD card itself.

### Prerequisite to Follow below steps:
To work with the following steps, you may follow either of the below procedure:
* Remove the uSD card, delete the uEnv.txt file from the uSD BOOT partition and then insert back the uSD to the Beaglebone black board.

### Steps:
